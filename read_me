Thanks to Pybliometrics and Elsevier teams :)

You will need an api key from the Elsevier Developer Portal first. Then you have to install these Python packages:

Run a terminal and put

pip install pybliometrics
pip install pandas

You have to paste the api key the first time you run the script. You can change it by modifiying the Pybliometrics config.ini file, too. 

If you need to work with proxies you have to install pysocks:

pip install pysocks

Proxy is optional for the Pybliometrics config.ini file. Here's an example:  

[Proxy]
ftp = http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80
http = socks5://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80
https = http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:80

Have fun!
